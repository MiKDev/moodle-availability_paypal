# moodle-availability_paypal
An Availability Condition for Moodle to require a PayPal payment to access activities and resources.

For each restriction you add, you can set a business email address, cost, currency, item name and item number.

This works like the PayPal enrol plugin (https://docs.moodle.org/en/Paypal_enrolment), but instead of restricting the full course, you can restrict individual activities, resources or sections (and you can combine it with other availability conditions, for example, to exclude some group from paying using and "or" restriction set).

The development of this plugin was funded by TRREE - TRAINING AND RESOURCES IN RESEARCH ETHICS EVALUATION - http://www.trree.org/
